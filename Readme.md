Up deploys infinitely scalable serverless apps, APIs, and static websites in seconds, so you can get back to working on what makes your project unique. Up focuses on deploying "vanilla" apps, there's nothing new to learn, just develop with your favorite existing frameworks like Express, Koa, Django, Golang net/http or others.

Up currently supports Node.js, Golang, Python, Crystal, and static sites out of the box. Up is provider-agnostic, supporting AWS Lambda and API Gateway as the first targets. You can think of Up as self-hosted Heroku style user experience for a fraction of the price, with the security, flexibility, and scalability of AWS.

Check out the [documentation](https://apex.github.io/up/), [examples](https://github.com/apex/up-examples), or chat with us in [Slack](https://apex-dev.azurewebsites.net/). Up is still very early in development, if you have no AWS experience you may want to hold off for a future release.

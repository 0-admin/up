title: Installation
---

Up can be installed via pre-compiled binaries, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/apex/up/releases) page, or use this one-liner which will install `up` to `/usr/local/bin` by default.

```
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apex/up/master/install.sh | sh
```

Verify installation with:

```
$ up version
```

Later when you want to update `up` to the latest version use the following command:

```
$ up upgrade
```

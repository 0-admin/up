Up can be installed via pre-compiled binaries, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/apex/up/releases) page. For example for Mac OS use:

```
$ curl -#L https://github.com/apex/up/releases/download/v0.1.6/up_0.1.6_darwin_amd64.tar.gz | tar -zx -C /usr/local/bin
```

Verify installation with:

```
$ up version
```

Later when you want to update `up` to the latest version use the following command:

```
$ up upgrade
```
